# hello-world
Hi everyone,

My name is Shiyi and I'm a student pursuing a master degree in Data Analytics Program. I'm a dog-person and I have an almost 2 years old Chihuahua. In my free time, I enjoy having picnic with my friends, watching dramas, and shopping. And, recently, I'm interested in camping, playing pickleball and flying discs.
